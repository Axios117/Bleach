# Bleach

Bleach's aim is to be a data analyze and visualization tool. It contains both server side and client side.

In fact, Bleach is a project that we just want to test new technology we have learnt. So you'll find out it will update irregular basis.

## Install

I suggest to use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to install the dependencies instead of npm. Of course you can use npm, it will work fine.

```shell
yarn install

# install client packages
cd packages/client && yarn install

# install server packages
cd packages/server && yarn install
```

Besides necessary dependencies, you also need to install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and start it, Because server needs a database to store data.

## Run

We need to start client and server respectively.

```shell
# start client
cd packages/client && yarn start

# start server
cd packages/server && yarn start
```

## Development

`packages/client` is totally generated by [Angular-CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). So you can use any command supported by Angular-CLI.

`packages/server` is written by typescript. So you can't start it as normal JavaScript node programs. I've provided some useful scripts to help you debug them.

* If you are using [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you could simplely debug it by pressing <kbd>F5</kbd>. But remember you still need to compile some ts code under directory `packages/server/src/app/workers`, because I've used worker to do some stuffs.

* If you like to debug it in your way, you can compile ts code to js code by typing `yarn run server:watch`, this will compile and watch your source code, and release them under `/packages/server/release`. The default file is named `index.js`.

* If you don't like neither way above, you can start it only by typing `yarn start` in your terminal.
